    //! For this method inputs are numbered 0..(nbInputs-1) and outputs are numbered nbInputs..(nbInputs+nbOutputs-1).
    //! Using this numbering, pos is an index into InOut, where 0 <= pos < nbInputs+nbOutputs.
    //!
    //! TensorRT invokes this method to ask if the input/output indexed by pos supports the format/datatype specified
