## Description

This sample, sampleIOFormats, uses a Caffe model that was trained on the [MNIST dataset](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md) and performs engine building and inference using TensorRT. The correctness of outputs is then compared to the golden reference. Specifically, it shows how to use APIs to explicitly specify I/O formats to `TensorFormat::kLINEAR` for Float32, and additionally `TensorFormat::kCHW2` and `TensorFormat::kHWC8` for Float16 and INT8 precision.

## How does this sample work?

`ITensor::setAllowedFormats` is invoked to specify which format is expected to be supported. 

	```
	bool SampleIOFormats::build(int dataWidth)
	{
		...

		network->getInput(0)->setAllowedFormats(static_cast<TensorFormats>(1 << static_cast<int>(mTensorFormat)));
		network->getOutput(0)->setAllowedFormats(static_cast<TensorFormats>(1 << static_cast<int>(mTensorFormat)));
		...
	}
	```

## Preparing sample data

1. Download the sample data from [TensorRT release tarball](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-tensorrt-download#), if not already mounted under `/usr/src/tensorrt/data` (NVIDIA NGC containers) and set it to `$TRT_DATADIR`.
    ```bash
    export TRT_DATADIR=/usr/src/tensorrt/data
    pushd $TRT_DATADIR/mnist
    pip3 install Pillow
    popd
    ```

## Running the sample

1. Compile the sample by following build instructions in [TensorRT README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/).

2.  Run inference on the digit looping from 0 to 9:
    ```bash
    ./sample_io_formats --datadir=<path/to/data> --useDLACore=N
    ```

    For example:
    ```bash
    ./sample_io_formats --datadir $TRT_DATADIR/mnist
    ```

3.  Verify that all 10 digits match correctly. If the sample runs successfully, you should see output similar to the following:
	```
	&&&& RUNNING TensorRT.sample_io_formats # ./sample_io_formats
	[I] The test chooses MNIST as the network and recognizes a randomly generated digit
	[I] Firstly it runs the FP32 as the golden data, then INT8/FP16 with different formats will be tested
	[I]
	[I] Building and running a FP32 GPU inference to get golden input/output
	[I] [TRT] Detected 1 input and 1 output network tensors.
	[I] Input:
	... (omitted message)
	&&&& PASSED TensorRT.sample_io_formats
	```
	This output shows that the sample ran successfully; `PASSED`.

## Changelog

Oct 2021
Change names and topic from "reformat-free" to "I/O formats", because `BuilderFlag::kSTRICT_TYPES`
is deprecated. "Reformat-free I/O" (see `BuilderFlag::kDIRECT_IO`) is generally counterproductive
and fragile, since it constrains the optimizer from choosing the fastest implementation,
and depends upon what kernels are available on a particular target.

June 2019
This is the first release of the `README.md` file and sample.
