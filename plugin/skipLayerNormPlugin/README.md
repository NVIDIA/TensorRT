## Description

Adds a residual tensor, applies layer normalization, i.e., transforms the mean and standard deviation to beta and gamma respectively.
Optionally can adds a bias vector before layer-normalization.


### Structure

The `skipLayerNormPlugin` takes two inputs; `input` and `skip`.

`input`
input is a tensor with shape `[S, B, E]` where `B` is the batch size and `E` is the hidden size.

`skip`
skip is a tensor with shape `[S, B, E]` where `B` is the batch size and `E` is the hidden size.
The purpose of this input is to introduce skip (aka. residual) connections to previously computed tensors.


The `skipLayerNormPlugin` generates the following output:

`output`
output is a tensor with shape `[S, B, E]` where `B` is the batch size.


## Parameters

`skipLayerNormPlugin` has plugin creator class `SkipLayerNormPluginDynamicCreator` and plugin class `CustomSkipLayerNormPluginDynamic`.

The parameters are defined below and consists of the following attributes:

| Type     | Parameter                               | Description
|----------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
|`int`     |`type_id`                                |Integer encoding the DataType (0: FP32, 1: FP16)
|`int`     |`ld`                                     |The leading dimension of the input tensor, corresponding to the hidden size, denoted by `E` above.
|`Weights` |`beta`                                   |The mean to normalize to. Shape: `[1, 1, E]`
|`Weights` |`gamma`                                  |The standard deviation to normalize to. Shape: `[1, 1, E]`
|`Weights` |`bias`                                   |An optional bias vector to add before normalization. Shape: `[1, 1, E]`
