## Description

The `MultilevelProposeROI` plugin generates the first-stage detection (ROI candidates) from the scores, refinement information from RPN(Region Proposal Network) and pre-defined anchors. It is
used in sampleMaskRCNN.   


### Structure

This plugin supports the NCHW format. It takes two input tensors: `object_score` and `object_delta` 

`object_score` is the objectness score from RPN. `object_score`'s shape is `[N, anchors, 2, 1]` where `N` is the batch_size, `anchors` is the total number of anchors and `2` means 2
classes of objectness --- foreground and background . 

`object_delta` is the refinement information from RPN of shape `[N, anchors, 4, 1]`. `4` means 4 elements of refinement information --- `[dy, dx, dh, dw]`

This plugin generates one output tensor of shape `[N, keep_topk, 4]` where `keep_topk` is the maximum number of detections left after NMS and `4` means coordinates of ROI
candidates `[y1, x1, y2, x2]`

Instead of fed as input in Keras, the default anchors used in this plugin are generated upon `initialization`.   
For resnet50 + 832*1344 input shape, the number of anchors can be computed as 
```
Anchors in feature map P2: 208*336*3
Anchors in feature map P3: 104*168*3
Anchors in feature map P4: 52*84*3
Anchors in feature map P5: 26*42*3
Anchors in feature map P6(maxpooling): 13*21*3

```

## Parameters

This plugin has the plugin creator class `MultilevelProposeROIPluginCreator` and the plugin class `MultilevelProposeROI`.
  
The following parameters were used to create `MultilevelProposeROI` instance:

| Type              | Parameter                        | Description
|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------
|`int`              |`prenms_topk`                     |The number of ROIs which will be kept before NMS. 
|`int`              |`keep_topk`                       |Number of detections will be kept after NMS.
|`float`            |`iou_threshold`                   |IOU threshold value used in NMS.
