Metapackage for NVIDIA TensorRT, which is an SDK that facilitates high-performance machine learning inference. It is designed to work in a complementary fashion with training frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and MXNet. It focuses specifically on running an already-trained network quickly and efficiently on NVIDIA hardware.

If the dependencies of this package cannot be correctly installed from PyPI for any reason, you can try using the NVIDIA package index instead:
```
export {}=0
pip install tensorrt
```
