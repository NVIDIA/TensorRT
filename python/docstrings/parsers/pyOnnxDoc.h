        The first element of the tuple indicates whether the model is supported.
        The second indicates subgraphs (by node index) in the model and whether they are supported.

    Get the i-th output ITensor object for the ONNX layer "name".

   In the case of multiple nodes sharing the same name this function will return
   the output tensors of the first instance of the node in the ONNX graph.

    :arg name: The name of the ONNX layer.

    :arg i: The index of the output.

    :returns: The output tensor or None if the layer was not found or an invalid index was provided.
)trtdoc";

constexpr const char* get_used_vc_plugin_libraries = R"trtdoc(
    Query the plugin libraries needed to implement operations used by the parser in a version-compatible engine.

    This provides a list of plugin libraries on the filesystem needed to implement operations
    in the parsed network.  If you are building a version-compatible engine using this network,
    provide this list to IBuilderConfig.set_plugins_to_serialize() to serialize these plugins along
    with the version-compatible engine, or, if you want to ship these plugin libraries externally
    to the engine, ensure that IPluginRegistry.load_library() is used to load these libraries in the
    appropriate runtime before deserializing the corresponding engine.

    :returns: List[str] List of plugin libraries found by the parser.

    :raises: :class:`RuntimeError` if an internal error occurred when trying to fetch the list of plugin libraries.

    Load a serialized ONNX model from memory and perform weight refit.

    Load and parse a ONNX model from disk and perform weight refit.
