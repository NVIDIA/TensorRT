    Query the plugin libraries needed to implement operations used by the parser in a version-compatible engine.

    This provides a list of plugin libraries on the filesystem needed to implement operations
    in the parsed network.  If you are building a version-compatible engine using this network,
    provide this list to IBuilderConfig.set_plugins_to_serialize() to serialize these plugins along
    with the version-compatible engine, or, if you want to ship these plugin libraries externally
    to the engine, ensure that IPluginRegistry.load_library() is used to load these libraries in the
    appropriate runtime before deserializing the corresponding engine.

constexpr const char* load_model_proto = R"trtdoc(
    Load a serialized ONNX model into the parser. Unlike the parse(), parse_from_file(), or parse_with_weight_descriptors()
    functions, this function does not immediately convert the model into a TensorRT INetworkDefinition. Using this function
    allows users to provide their own initializers for the ONNX model through the load_initializer() function.

    Only one model can be loaded at a time. Subsequent calls to load_model_proto() will result in an error.

    To begin the conversion of the model into a TensorRT INetworkDefinition, use parse_model_proto().

    Prompt the ONNX parser to load an initializer with user-provided binary data.
    The lifetime of the data must exceed the lifetime of the parser.

    All user-provided initializers must be provided prior to calling parse_model_proto().

    This function can be called multiple times to specify the names of multiple initializers.

    Calling this function with an initializer previously specified will overwrite the previous instance.

    This function will return false if initializer validation fails. Possible validation errors are:
     * This function was called prior to load_model_proto().
     * The requested initializer was not found in the model.
     * The size of the data provided is different from the corresponding initializer in the model.

    :arg name: name of the initializer.
