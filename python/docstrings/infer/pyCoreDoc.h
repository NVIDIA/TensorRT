namespace IOptimizationProfileDoc
{

    Optimization profile for dynamic input dimensions and shape tensors.

    When building an :class:`ICudaEngine` from an :class:`INetworkDefinition` that has dynamically resizable inputs (at least
    one input tensor has one or more of its dimensions specified as -1) or shape input tensors, users need to specify
    at least one optimization profile. Optimization profiles are numbered 0, 1, ...

    The first optimization profile that has been defined (with index 0) will be used by the :class:`ICudaEngine` whenever no
    optimization profile has been selected explicitly. If none of the inputs are dynamic, the default optimization
    profile will be generated automatically unless it is explicitly provided by the user (this is possible but not
    required in this case). If more than a single optimization profile is defined, users may set a target how
    much additional weight space should be maximally allocated to each additional profile (as a fraction of the
    maximum, unconstrained memory).

    Users set optimum input tensor dimensions, as well as minimum and maximum input tensor dimensions. The builder
    selects the kernels that result in the lowest runtime for the optimum input tensor dimensions, and are valid for
    all input tensor sizes in the valid range between minimum and maximum dimensions. A runtime error will be raised
    if the input tensor dimensions fall outside the valid range for this profile. Likewise, users provide minimum,
    optimum, and maximum values for all shape tensor input values.

    :class:`IOptimizationProfile` implements :func:`__nonzero__` and :func:`__bool__` such that evaluating a profile as a :class:`bool` (e.g. ``if profile:``) will check whether the optimization profile can be passed to an IBuilderConfig object. This will perform partial validation, by e.g. checking that the maximum dimensions are at least as large as the optimum dimensions, and that the optimum dimensions are always as least as large as the minimum dimensions. Some validation steps require knowledge of the network definition and are deferred to engine build time.

    :ivar extra_memory_target: Additional memory that the builder should aim to maximally allocate for this profile, as a fraction of the memory it would use if the user did not impose any constraints on memory. This unconstrained case is the default; it corresponds to ``extra_memory_target`` == 1.0. If ``extra_memory_target`` == 0.0, the builder aims to create the new optimization profile without allocating any additional weight memory. Valid inputs lie between 0.0 and 1.0. This parameter is only a hint, and TensorRT does not guarantee that the ``extra_memory_target`` will be reached. This parameter is ignored for the first (default) optimization profile that is defined.

constexpr char const* set_shape = R"trtdoc(
    Set the minimum/optimum/maximum dimensions for a dynamic input tensor.

    This function must be called for any network input tensor that has dynamic dimensions. If ``min``, ``opt``, and ``max`` are the minimum, optimum, and maximum dimensions, and ``real_shape`` is the shape for this input tensor provided to the :class:`INetworkDefinition` ,then the following conditions must hold:

    (1) ``len(min)`` == ``len(opt)`` == ``len(max)`` == ``len(real_shape)``
    (2) 0 <= ``min[i]`` <= ``opt[i]`` <= ``max[i]`` for all ``i``

constexpr char const* set_shape_input = R"trtdoc(
    Set the minimum/optimum/maximum values for a shape input tensor.

    are fixed at network definition time. This function must NOT be called for any input tensor that is not a
    shape tensor.

    An error occurred when performing an allocation of memory on the host or the device.

constexpr char const* FAILED_EXECUTION = R"trtdoc(
    An error occurred during execution that caused TensorRT to end prematurely, either an asynchronous error,
    user cancellation, or other execution errors reported by CUDA/DLA. In a dynamic system, the
    data can be thrown away and the next frame can be processed or execution can be retried.
    This is either an execution error or a memory error.

constexpr char const* FAILED_COMPUTATION = R"trtdoc(
    An error occurred during execution that caused the data to become corrupted, but execution finished. Examples
    of this error are NaN squashing or integer overflow. In a dynamic system, the data can be thrown away and the

    This is either a data corruption error, an input error, or a range error.
)trtdoc";

constexpr char const* INVALID_STATE = R"trtdoc(
    TensorRT was put into a bad state by incorrect sequence of function calls. An example of an invalid state is
    specifying a layer to be DLA only without GPU fallback, and that layer is not supported by DLA. This can occur
    in situations where a service is optimistically executing networks for multiple different configurations
    without checking proper error configurations, and instead throwing away bad configurations caught by TensorRT.
    This is a violation of the API contract, but can be recoverable.

    Example of a recovery:
    GPU fallback is disabled and conv layer with large filter(63x63) is specified to run on DLA. This will fail due
    to DLA not supporting the large kernel size. This can be recovered by either turning on GPU fallback
    or setting the layer to run on the GPU.
)trtdoc";

constexpr char const* UNSUPPORTED_STATE = R"trtdoc(
    An error occurred due to the network not being supported on the device due to constraints of the hardware or
    system. An example is running a unsafe layer in a safety certified context, or a resource requirement for the
    current network is greater than the capabilities of the target device. The network is otherwise correct, but
    the network and hardware combination is problematic. This can be recoverable.
    Examples:
    * Scratch space requests larger than available device memory and can be recovered by increasing allowed workspace size.
    * Tensor size exceeds the maximum element count and can be recovered by reducing the maximum batch size.

namespace IErrorRecorderDoc
{
constexpr char const* descr = R"trtdoc(
    Reference counted application-implemented error reporting interface for TensorRT objects.

    The error reporting mechanism is a user defined object that interacts with the internal state of the object
    that it is assigned to in order to determine information about abnormalities in execution. The error recorder
    gets both an error enum that is more descriptive than pass/fail and also a description that gives more
    detail on the exact failure modes. In the safety context, the error strings are all limited to 128 characters
    in length.
    The ErrorRecorder gets passed along to any class that is created from another class that has an ErrorRecorder
    assigned to it. For example, assigning an ErrorRecorder to an Builder allows all INetwork's, ILayer's, and
    ITensor's to use the same error recorder. For functions that have their own ErrorRecorder accessor functions.
    This allows registering a different error recorder or de-registering of the error recorder for that specific
    object.

    The ErrorRecorder object implementation must be thread safe if the same ErrorRecorder is passed to different
    interface objects being executed in parallel in different threads. All locking and synchronization is
    pushed to the interface implementation and TensorRT does not hold any synchronization primitives when accessing
    the interface functions.

constexpr char const* has_overflowed = R"trtdoc(
    Determine if the error stack has overflowed.

    In the case when the number of errors is large, this function is used to query if one or more
    errors have been dropped due to lack of storage capacity. This is especially important in the
    automotive safety case where the internal error handling mechanisms cannot allocate memory.

    :returns: True if errors have been dropped due to overflowing the error stack.

constexpr char const* get_num_errors = R"trtdoc(
    Return the number of errors

    Determines the number of errors that occurred between the current point in execution
    and the last time that the clear() was executed. Due to the possibility of asynchronous
    errors occuring, a TensorRT API can return correct results, but still register errors
    with the Error Recorder. The value of getNbErrors must monotonically increases until clear()
    is called.

    :returns: Returns the number of errors detected, or 0 if there are no errors.

constexpr char const* get_error_code = R"trtdoc(

    The error_idx specifies what error code from 0 to :attr:`num_errors`-1 that the application

constexpr char const* get_error_desc = R"trtdoc(

    may be truncated. The format of the error description is "<EnumAsStr> - <Description>".

constexpr char const* clear = R"trtdoc(

constexpr char const* report_error = R"trtdoc(
    Clear the error stack on the error recorder.

    Report an error to the user that has a given value and human readable description. The function returns false
    if processing can continue, which implies that the reported error is not fatal. This does not guarantee that
    processing continues, but provides a hint to TensorRT.

    :arg val: The error code enum that is being reported.
    :arg desc: The description of the error.

    :returns: True if the error is determined to be fatal and processing of the current function must end.

Flags used to control TensorRT's behavior when creating executable temporary files.

On some platforms the TensorRT runtime may need to create files in a temporary directory or use platform-specific

application to explicitly control TensorRT's use of these files. This will preclude the use of certain TensorRT
APIs for deserializing and loading lean runtimes.

These should be treated as bit offsets, e.g. in order to allow in-memory files for a given :class:`IRuntime`:

When timing layers, the builder minimizes over a set of average times for layer execution. This parameter controls the number of iterations used in averaging. By default the number of averaging iterations is 1.
        :ivar int8_calibrator: :class:`IInt8Calibrator` Int8 Calibration interface. The calibrator is to minimize the information loss during the INT8 quantization process.
        :ivar flags: :class:`int` The build mode flags to turn on builder options for this network. The flags are listed in the BuilderFlags enum. The flags set configuration options to build the network. This should be in integer consisting of one or more :class:`BuilderFlag` s, combined via binary OR. For example, ``1 << BuilderFlag.FP16 | 1 << BuilderFlag.DEBUG``.

        :ivar profiling_verbosity: Profiling verbosity in NVTX annotations.
        :ivar engine_capability: The desired engine capability. See :class:`EngineCapability` for details.
        :ivar algorithm_selector: The :class:`IAlgorithmSelector` to use.
        :ivar builder_optimization_level: The builder optimization level which TensorRT should build the engine at. Setting a higher optimization level allows TensorRT to spend longer engine building time searching for more optimization options. The resulting engine may have better performance compared to an engine built with a lower optimization level. The default optimization level is 3. Valid values include integers from 0 to the maximum optimization level, which is currently 5. Setting it to be greater than the maximum level results in identical behavior to the maximum level.
        :ivar hardware_compatibility_level: Hardware compatibility allows an engine compatible with GPU architectures other than that of the GPU on which the engine was built.
        :ivar plugins_to_serialize: The plugin libraries to be serialized with forward-compatible engines.
        :ivar max_aux_streams: The maximum number of auxiliary streams that TRT is allowed to use. If the network contains operators that can run in parallel, TRT can execute them using auxiliary streams in addition to the one provided to the IExecutionContext::enqueueV3() call. The default maximum number of auxiliary streams is determined by the heuristics in TensorRT on whether enabling multi-stream would improve the performance. This behavior can be overridden by calling this API to set the maximum number of auxiliary streams explicitly. Set this to 0 to enforce single-stream inference. The resulting engine may use fewer auxiliary streams than the maximum if the network does not contain enough parallelism or if TensorRT determines that using more auxiliary streams does not help improve the performance. Allowing more auxiliary streams does not always give better performance since there will be synchronizations overhead between streams. Using CUDA graphs at runtime can help reduce the overhead caused by cross-stream synchronizations. Using more auxiliary leads to more memory usage at runtime since some activation memory blocks will not be able to be reused.
        :ivar progress_monitor: The :class:`IProgressMonitor` to use.

        Below are the descriptions about each builder optimization level:

        - Level 0: This enables the fastest compilation by disabling dynamic kernel generation and selecting the first tactic that succeeds in execution. This will also not respect a timing cache.
        - Level 1: Available tactics are sorted by heuristics, but only the top are tested to select the best. If a dynamic kernel is generated its compile optimization is low.
        - Level 2: Available tactics are sorted by heuristics, but only the fastest tactics are tested to select the best.
        - Level 3: Apply heuristics to see if a static precompiled kernel is applicable or if a new one has to be compiled dynamically.
        - Level 4: Always compiles a dynamic kernel.
        - Level 5: Always compiles a dynamic kernel and compares it to static kernels.
