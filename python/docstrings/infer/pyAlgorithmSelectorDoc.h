    Interface implemented by application for selecting and reporting algorithms of a layer provided by the
    builder.
    note A layer in context of algorithm selection may be different from ILayer in INetworkDefiniton.
    For example, an algorithm might be implementing a conglomeration of multiple ILayers in INetworkDefinition.

    To implement a custom algorithm selector, ensure that you explicitly instantiate the base class in :func:`__init__` :
    ::

        class MyAlgoSelector(trt.IAlgorithmSelector):
            def __init__(self):
                trt.IAlgorithmSelector.__init__(self)

constexpr const char* select_algorithms = R"trtdoc(
    Select Algorithms for a layer from the given list of algorithm choices.

    Note: TRT uses its default algorithm selection to choose from the list returned by the user.
    If the returned list is empty, TRTâ€™s default algorithm selection is used unless strict type constraints are set.
    The list of choices is valid only for this specific algorithm context.

    For example, the simplest implementation looks like this:
    ::

        def select_algorithms(self, context, choices):
            assert len(choices) > 0
            return list(range(len(choices)))

    :arg context: The context for which the algorithm choices are valid.
    :arg choices: The list of algorithm choices to select for implementation of this layer.

    :returns: A :class:`List[int]` indicating the indices from the choices vector that TensorRT should choose from.

)trtdoc";

constexpr const char* report_algorithms = R"trtdoc(
    Called by TensorRT to report choices it made.

    Note: For a given optimization profile, this call comes after all calls to select_algorithms.
    choices[i] is the choice that TensorRT made for algoContexts[i], for i in [0, num_algorithms-1]

    For example, a possible implementation may look like this:
    ::

        def report_algorithms(self, contexts, choices):
            # Prints the time of the chosen algorithm by TRT from the
            # selection list passed in by select_algorithms
            for choice in choices:
                print(choice.timing_msec)

    :arg contexts: The list of all algorithm contexts.
    :arg choices: The list of algorithm choices made by TensorRT corresponding to each context.
