    Declare a size tensor at the given output index, with the specified auto-tuning formula and upper bound.

    A size tensor allows a plugin to have output dimensions that cannot be computed solely from input dimensions.
    For example, suppose a plugin implements the equivalent of INonZeroLayer for 2D input. The plugin can
    have one output for the indices of non-zero elements, and a second output containing the number of non-zero
    elements. Suppose the input has size [M,N] and has K non-zero elements. The plugin can write K to the second
    output. When telling TensorRT that the first output has shape [2,K], plugin uses IExprBuilder.constant() and
    IExprBuilder.declare_size_tensor(1,...) to create the IDimensionExpr that respectively denote 2 and K.

    TensorRT also needs to know the value of K to use for auto-tuning and an upper bound on K so that it can
    allocate memory for the output tensor. In the example, suppose typically half of the plugin's input elements
    are non-zero, and all the elements might be nonzero. then using M*N/2 might be a good expression for the opt
    parameter, and M*N for the upper bound. IDimensionsExpr for these expressions can be constructed from
    IDimensionsExpr for the input dimensions.
