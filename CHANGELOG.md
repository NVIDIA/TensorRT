# TensorRT OSS Release Changelog

## [8.2.0 EA](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/release-notes/tensorrt-8.html#rel-8-2-0-EA) - 2021-10-05
### Added
- [Demo applications](demo/HuggingFace) showcasing TensorRT inference of [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers).
  - Support is currently extended to GPT-2 and T5 models.
- Added support for the following ONNX operators:
  - `Einsum`
  - `IsNan`
  - `GatherND`
  - `Scatter`
  - `ScatterElements`
  - `ScatterND`
  - `Sign`
  - `Round`
- Added support for building TensorRT Python API on Windows.

### Updated
- Notable API updates in TensorRT 8.2.0.6 EA release. See [TensorRT Developer Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html) for details.
  - Added three new APIs, `IExecutionContext: getEnqueueEmitsProfile()`, `setEnqueueEmitsProfile()`, and `reportToProfiler()` which can be used to collect layer profiling info when the inference is launched as a CUDA graph.
  - Eliminated the global logger; each `Runtime`, `Builder` or `Refitter` now has its own logger.
  - Added new operators: `IAssertionLayer`, `IConditionLayer`, `IEinsumLayer`, `IIfConditionalBoundaryLayer`, `IIfConditionalOutputLayer`, `IIfConditionalInputLayer`, and `IScatterLayer`.
  - Added new `IGatherLayer` modes: `kELEMENT` and `kND`
  - Added new `ISliceLayer` modes: `kFILL`, `kCLAMP`, and `kREFLECT`
  - Added new `IUnaryLayer` operators: `kSIGN` and `kROUND`
  - Added new runtime class `IEngineInspector` that can be used to inspect the detailed information of an engine, including the layer parameters, the chosen tactics, the precision used, etc.
  - `ProfilingVerbosity` enums have been updated to show their functionality more explicitly.
- Updated TensorRT OSS container defaults to cuda 11.4
- CMake to target C++14 builds.
- Updated following ONNX operators:
  - `Gather` and `GatherElements` implementations to natively support negative indices
  - `Pad` layer to support ND padding, along with `edge` and `reflect` padding mode support
  - `If` layer with general performance improvements.

### Removed
- Removed `sampleMLP`.
- Several flags of trtexec have been deprecated:
  - `--explicitBatch` flag has been deprecated and has no effect. When the input model is in UFF or in Caffe prototxt format, the implicit batch dimension mode is used automatically; when the input model is in ONNX format, the explicit batch mode is used automatically.
  - `--explicitPrecision` flag has been deprecated and has no effect. When the input ONNX model contains Quantization/Dequantization nodes, TensorRT automatically uses explicit precision mode.
  - `--nvtxMode=[verbose|default|none]` has been deprecated in favor of `--profilingVerbosity=[detailed|layer_names_only|none]` to show its functionality more explicitly.

### Changed
- Update Polygraphy to [v0.30.3](tools/Polygraphy/CHANGELOG.md#v0303-2021-06-25).
- Update ONNX-GraphSurgeon to [v0.3.10](tools/onnx-graphsurgeon/CHANGELOG.md#v0310-2021-05-20).
- Update Pytorch Quantization toolkit to v2.1.0.
- Notable TensorRT API updates
  - TensorRT now declares API’s with the `noexcept` keyword. All TensorRT classes that an application inherits from (such as IPluginV2) must guarantee that methods called by TensorRT do not throw uncaught exceptions, or the behavior is undefined.
  - Destructors for classes with `destroy()` methods were previously protected. They are now public, enabling use of smart pointers for these classes. The `destroy()` methods are deprecated.
- Moved `RefitMap` API from ONNX parser to core TensorRT.
- Various bugfixes for plugins, samples and ONNX parser.
- Port demoBERT to tensorflow2 and update UFF samples to leverage nvidia-tensorflow1 container.

### Removed
- `IPlugin` and `IPluginFactory` interfaces were deprecated in TensorRT 6.0 and have been removed in TensorRT 8.0. We recommend that you write new plugins or refactor existing ones to target the `IPluginV2DynamicExt` and `IPluginV2IOExt` interfaces. For more information, refer to [Migrating Plugins From TensorRT 6.x Or 7.x To TensorRT 8.x.x](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/developer-guide/index.html#migrating-plugins-6x-7x-to-8x).
  - For plugins based on `IPluginV2DynamicExt` and `IPluginV2IOExt`, certain methods with legacy function signatures (derived from `IPluginV2` and `IPluginV2Ext` base classes) which were deprecated and marked for removal in TensorRT 8.0 will no longer be available.
- Removed `samplePlugin` since it showcased IPluginExt interface, which is no longer supported in TensorRT 8.0.
- Removed `sampleMovieLens` and `sampleMovieLensMPS`.
- Removed Dockerfile for Ubuntu 16.04. TensorRT 8.0 debians for Ubuntu 16.04 require python 3.5 while minimum required python version for TensorRT OSS is 3.6.
- Removed support for PowerPC builds, consistent with TensorRT GA releases.

### Notes
- We had deprecated the Caffe Parser and UFF Parser in TensorRT 7.0. They are still tested and functional in TensorRT 8.0, however, we plan to remove the support in a future release. Ensure you migrate your workflow to use `tf2onnx`, `keras2onnx` or [TensorFlow-TensorRT (TF-TRT)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tf-trt-user-guide/index.html).
- Refer to [TensorRT 8.0.1 GA Release Notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/tensorrt/archives/tensorrt-801/release-notes/tensorrt-8.html#rel_8-0-1) for additional details
