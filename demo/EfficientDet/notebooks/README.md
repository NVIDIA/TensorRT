# TensorRT demo with EfficientDet

To run the demo Jupyter notebook in this folder, follow the instructions in the TRT setup guide to generate the TensorRT-OSS docker container, and build TensorRT-OSS.

As specified in the guide for setting up the build environment, specify port number using `--jupyter <port>` to launch Jupyter lab interface with the container.
