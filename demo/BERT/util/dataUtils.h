//! \details The function loads the weights of the BERT network from a weights file. The Weights in the dictionary own
//! the storage behind the Weights::values pointer. It is therefore the callers responsibility to free it. See also helpers/convert_weights.py

//! \brief Loads a batch of inputs
//! \details The function loads inputs for the network consisting batches of tokenized text, input masks and segement ids.
//! Each batch is represented as a matrix of int32 elements of size sequence length x batch size.
//! Each batch is assumed to have the same sequence length S, which the function outputs, so that the batch size of each batch can be computed.
//! If multiple batches are present, tokens, masks and segement ids are associated with each other in the order in which they are encountered.
//! See also helpers/generate_dbg.py
//!\param path Path to the input file
//!\param Bmax Ouputs the largest batch size encountered
//!\param S Outputs the sequence lenght of the inputs
//!\param inputIds Vector of input id batches
//!\param inputMasks  Vector of input mask batches
//!\param segmentIds Vector of segment id batches

//! \brief infers the characteristic sizes of the BERT network from loaded weights
//! \param weightMap Loaded weights. See loadWeights
//! \param hiddenSize Outputs hidden size, which is numHeads * headSize and equals the embeddings dimension
//! \param intermediateSize Outputs the intermediate size in the transformer which is typically 4 x hidden size
//! \param numHiddenLayers Outputs the number of transformer layers requested
