    "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ([BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) is a method of pre-training language representations which obtains state-of-the-art results on a wide array of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. \n",

    "BERT provided a leap in accuracy for NLU tasks that brought high-quality language-based services within the reach of companies across many industries. To use the model in production, you need to consider factors such as latency, in addition to accuracy, which influences end user satisfaction with a service. BERT requires significant compute during inference due to its 12/24-layer stacked multi-head attention network. This has posed a challenge for companies to deploy BERT as part of real-time applications until now.\n",

TensorRT provides INT8 and FP16 optimizations for production deployments of deep learning inference applications such as video streaming, speech recognition, recommendation, fraud detection, and natural language processing.\n",
    "TensorRT optimizations for BERT allows you to perform inference in 2.2 ms on T4 GPUs. This is 17x faster than CPU-only platforms and is well within the 10ms latency budget necessary for conversational AI applications. These optimizations make it practical to use BERT in production, for example, as part of a conversation AI service.\n",

We use custom plugins that accelerate key operations in the Transformer Encoder elements in a BERT model. The plugins fuse multiple operations into a sub-graph in a single CUDA kernel.  Each sub-graph consists of several elementary computations, each of which requires a read and write to the global memory of the GPU (i.e. the slowest on-device memory).  By fusing the elementary operations together into a single CUDA kernel we allow for the computation to happen on a larger sub-graph while visiting the global memory a minimal amount of times. \n",

For each question+answer pair, if the characters of the model's prediction exactly match the characters of (one of) the True Answer(s), EM = 1, otherwise EM = 0. This is a strict all-or-nothing metric; being off by a single character results in a score of 0. When assessing against a negative example, if the model predicts any text at all, it automatically receives a 0 for that example.\n",

In this case, it's computed over the individual words in the prediction against those in the True Answer. The number of shared words between the prediction and the truth is the basis of the F1 score: precision is the ratio of the number of shared words to the total number of words in the prediction, and recall is the ratio of the number of shared words to the total number of words in the ground truth.\n",

Several models need to execute in a sequence in response to a single user query.

Longer times lead to a sluggish performance and a poor customer experience.\n",

Using the TensorRT optimized sample, you can execute up to a batch size of 8 for BERT-base and even higher batch sizes for models with fewer Transformer layers within the 10 ms latency budget.
