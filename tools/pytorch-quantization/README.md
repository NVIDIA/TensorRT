# Pytorch Quantization

PyTorch-Quantization is a toolkit for training and evaluating PyTorch models with simulated quantization. Quantization can be added to the model automatically, or manually, allowing the model to be tuned for accuracy and performance. Quantization is compatible with NVIDIAs high performance integer kernels which leverage integer Tensor Cores. The quantized model can be exported to ONNX and imported by TensorRT 8.0 and later.
