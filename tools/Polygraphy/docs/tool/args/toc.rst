Command-line Argument Groups
============================

Command-line argument groups bundle arguments and related functionality together into reusable components
and are used throughout the Polygraphy command-line toolkit.

Argument groups are used to add new command-line tools to Polygraphy or extend existing tools with new functionality.

Module: ``polygraphy.tools.args``
