# Matching and replacing a subgraph with a plugin in an onnx model


## Introduction

The `plugin` tool offers subtools to find and replace subgraphs in an onnx model.

Subgraph substition is a three-step process:
1. Find matching subgraphs based on the plugin's graph pattern (pattern.py) and list the potential substitutions in a user-editable intermediate file (config.yaml)
2. Review and edit (if necessary) the list of potential substitutions (config.yaml)
3. Replace subgraphs with plugins based on the list of potential substitutions (config.yaml)


`original.onnx` -------> `match` -------> `config.yaml` -------> `replace` -------> `replaced.onnx`
`plugins` ----------------^   `usr input`---^    `plugins`--------^                     

## Details

### Match
Finding matchings subgraphs in a model is done based on a graph pattern description (`pattern.py`) provided by the plugins.
The graph pattern description (`pattern.py`) contains information about the topology and additional constraints for the graph nodes, and a way to calculate the plugin's attributes based on the matching subgraph. 
Only plugins which provide a graph pattern description (pattern.py) are considered for matching.

The result of the matching is stored in an intermediate file called `config.yaml`. 
The user should review and edit this file, as it serves as a TODO list for the replacement step. For example, if there are 2 matching subgraphs, but only one should be substituted, the result can be removed from the file.

As a preview/dry-run step, the `plugin list` subtool can show the list of potential substitutions without generating an intermediate file.

### Replace
Replacement of subgraphs with plugins uses the `config.yaml` file generated in the matching stage. Any matching subgraph listed in this file is going to be removed and replaced with a single node representing the plugin. The original file is kept, and a new file is saved where the replacements are done. This file by default is called `replaced.onnx`.

### Compare
The original and the replaced model can be compared to check if they behave the same way before and after plugin substitution:
`polygraphy run original.onnx --trt --save-outputs model_output.json`
`polygraphy run replaced.onnx --trt --load-outputs model_output.json`

## Running The Example

1. Find and save matches of toyPlugin in the example network:

    ```bash
    polygraphy plugin match toy_subgraph.onnx \
        --plugin-dir ./plugins -o config.yaml
    ```

    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore Start -->
    This will display something like:

    ```
    checking toyPlugin in model
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    [I] 	Checking node: n1 against pattern node: Anode.
    [I] 	No match because: Op did not match. Node op was: O but pattern op was: A.
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    [I] Found a matched subgraph!
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    ```

    The resulting config.yaml will look like:

    ```
    name: toyPlugin
    instances:
    - inputs:
    - i1
    - i1
    outputs:
    - o1
    - o2
    attributes:
        x: 1
    ```
    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore End -->

2. **[Optional]** List matches of toyPlugin in the example network, without saving config.yaml:

    ```bash
    polygraphy plugin list toy_subgraph.onnx \
        --plugin-dir ./plugins
    ```

    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore Start -->
    This will display something like:

    ```
    checking toyPlugin in model
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    [I] 	Checking node: n1 against pattern node: Anode.
    [I] 	No match because: Op did not match. Node op was: O but pattern op was: A.
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    ...
    [I] Found a matched subgraph!
    [I] Start a subgraph matching...
    [I] 	Checking node: n6 against pattern node: Anode.
    [I] 	No match because: Op did not match. Node op was: E but pattern op was: A.
    the following plugins would be used:
    {'toyPlugin': 1}
    ```

    There will be no resulting config.yaml, as this command is only for printing the number of matches per plugin
    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore End -->

The `plugin replace` subtool replaces subgraphs in an onnx model with plugins


3. Replace parts of the example network with toyPlugin:

    ```bash
    polygraphy plugin replace toy_subgraph.onnx \
        --plugin-dir ./plugins --config config.yaml -o replaced.onnx
    ```

    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore Start -->
    This will display something like:

    ```
    [I] Loading model: /Users/pkisfaludi/Documents/git/Polygraphy/examples/cli/plugin/03_replace_subgraph_with_a_plugin/toy_subgraph.onnx
    ```

    The result file is replaced.onnx, where a subgraph in the example network is replaced by toyPlugin
    <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore End -->
