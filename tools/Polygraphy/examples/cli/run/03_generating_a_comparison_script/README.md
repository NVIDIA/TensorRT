# Generating A Script For Advanced Comparisons

For more advanced requirements, you may want to use the [API](../../../../polygraphy).
Instead of writing a script from scratch, you can use `run`'s `--gen-script` option
to create a Python script that you can use as a starting point.

First, generate a comparison script:

```bash
polygraphy run ../../../models/identity.onnx --trt --onnxrt \
    --gen-script=compare_trt_onnxrt.py
```

The generated script will do exactly what the `run` command would otherwise do.
You are free to modify this script, and finally run it:

```bash
python3 compare_trt_onnxrt.py
```
