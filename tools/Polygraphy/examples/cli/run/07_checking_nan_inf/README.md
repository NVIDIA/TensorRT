# Checking for Intermediate NaN or Infinities

## Introduction

When debugging model accuracy issues in Polygraphy, it can be helpful to check layerwise outputs for potential problems. Polygraphy's `run` subtool provides a helpful flag `--validate` which can quickly diagnose problematic intermediate outputs.

This example demonstrates use of this flag with a model which intentionally generates an
infinite output by adding infinity to the input tensor.

## Running The Example

 <!-- Polygraphy Test: XFAIL Start -->
```bash
polygraphy run add_infinity.onnx --onnx-outputs mark all --onnxrt --validate
```
 <!-- Polygraphy Test: XFAIL End -->

 <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore Start -->
You should see output like:
```
[I] onnxrt-runner-N0-05/13/22-22:35:48  | Completed 1 iteration(s) in 0.1326 ms | Average inference time: 0.1326 ms.
[I] Output Validation | Runners: ['onnxrt-runner-N0-05/13/22-22:35:48']
[I]     onnxrt-runner-N0-05/13/22-22:35:48  | Validating output: B (check_inf=True, check_nan=True)
[I]         mean=inf, std-dev=nan, var=nan, median=inf, min=inf at (0,), max=inf at (0,), avg-magnitude=inf
[E]         Inf Detected | One or more non-finite values were encountered in this output
[I]         Note: Use -vv or set logging verbosity to EXTRA_VERBOSE to display non-finite values
[E]         FAILED | Errors detected in output: B
[E]     FAILED | Output Validation
```
 <!-- Polygraphy Test: Ignore End -->
