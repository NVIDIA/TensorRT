This file defines the `ReplaceReshapes` loader, which takes an ONNX-GraphSurgeon graph
and replaces any no-op Reshapes with Identity nodes.

The loader implements the standard `BaseLoader` interface.

from polygraphy.backend.base import BaseLoader
from polygraphy.logger import G_LOGGER

# For any external dependencies besides `polygraphy`, you should use `mod.lazy_import`.
# This will enable Polygraphy to automatically install the dependency at runtime if required.
#
# NOTE: As the name implies, `lazy_import` does *not* import the module until the first time it is
#       accessed. Thus, you should be careful to avoid an antipattern like:
#
#   my_module = mod.lazy_import("my_module")
#   submodule = my_module.submodule
#
# The second line will trigger an immediate import of `my_module`.
# Instead, use something like:
#
#   submodule = mod.lazy_import("my_module.submodule")
#
gs = mod.lazy_import("onnx_graphsurgeon")


# `mod.export()` adds the decorated class or function to this module's __all__ attribute.
# When we do an `import *` from the `__init__.py` file in this submodule, this will ensure
# that only the decorated objects are exported.
#
# NOTE: We use `funcify=True` so that an immediately evaluated functional loader (called `replace_reshapes`)
#       will be automatically generated for us. This won't be used by the command-line toolkit, but could
#       be useful if this module is ever used via the Python API.
