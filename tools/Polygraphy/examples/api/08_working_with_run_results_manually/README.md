# Working With Run Results Manually

## Introduction

The inference outputs generated by `Comparator.run` are stored in a `RunResults` object,
which can keep track of the outputs of multiple runners from multiple inference iterations.
Command-line tools providing a `--save-outputs` option also save the outputs in this format.

Generally, you'll only use `RunResults` with other Polygraphy APIs or
tools (as in [this example](../../cli//run/06_comparing_with_custom_output_data/)
or [this one](../../cli/inspect/05_inspecting_inference_outputs/)), but sometimes,
you may want to work with the outputs manually.

Polygraphy includes convenience APIs that make it easy to load and manipulate `RunResults` objects.

This example illustrates how you can load `RunResults` from a file using the Python API
and then access the runner inference outputs stored within.

## Running The Example

1. Generate some inference results:

    ```bash
    polygraphy run identity.onnx --trt --onnxrt \
        --save-outputs outputs.json
    ```

2. **[Optional]** Use `inspect data` to view the outputs on the command-line:

    ```bash
    polygraphy inspect data outputs.json --show-values
    ```

3. Run the example:

    ```bash
    python3 example.py
    ```
