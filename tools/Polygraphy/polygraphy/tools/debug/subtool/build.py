class Build(BaseCheckerSubtool):
    r"""
    Repeatedly build an engine to isolate faulty tactics.

    `debug build` follows the same general process as other `debug` subtools.
    Specifically, it does the following during each iteration:

    1. Builds a TensorRT engine and saves it in the current directory as `polygraphy_debug.engine` by default.
    2. Evaluates it using the `--check` command if it was provided, or in interactive mode otherwise.
    3. Sorts files specified by `--artifacts` into `good` and `bad` directories based on (2).
        This is useful for sorting tactic replays, which can then be further analyzed with `debug diff-tactics`.

    The typical usage of `debug build` is:

        polygraphy debug build <model> [trt_build_options...] [--save-tactics <replay_file>] \
            [--artifacts <replay_file>] --until <num_iterations> \
            [--check <check_command>]

    `polygraphy run` is usually a good choice for the `--check` command.
