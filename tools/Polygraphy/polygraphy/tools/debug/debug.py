class Debug(Tool):
    r"""
    [EXPERIMENTAL] Debug a wide variety of model issues.

    Most of the `debug` subtools work on the same general principles:

    1. Iteratively perform some task that generates some output
    2. Evaluate the generated output to determine if it should be considered `good` or `bad`
    3. Sort any tracked artifacts into `good` and `bad` directories based on (2)

    The "some output" referred to in (1) is usually a model file and is written to the current
    directory by default during each iteration.

    In order to distinguish between `good` and `bad`, the subtool uses one of two methods:
        a. The `--check` command, if one is provided. It can be virtually any command, which makes `debug` extremely flexible.
        b. Prompting you. If no `--check` command is provided, the subtool will prompt you in an interactive fashion
            to report whether the iteration passed or failed.

    Artifacts to track can be specified with `--artifacts`. When the iteration fails,
    they are moved into the `bad` directory and otherwise into the `good` directory.

    By default, if the status code of the `--check` command is non-zero, the iteration is considered a failure.
    You can optionally use additional command-line options to control what counts as a failure in a more fine-grained way.
    For example:
        * `--fail-regex` allows you to count faliures only when the output of `--check` (on `stdout` or `stderr`)
            matches one or more regular expression(s) and ignore any other errors.
        * `--fail-returncode` lets you specify a status code to count as a failure, excluding all other non-zeros status
            codes.

    Most subtools also provide a replay mechanism where a 'debug replay' file containing information about the
    status of each iteration is saved after each iteration. This can then be loaded during subsequent debugging commands
    in order to quickly resume debugging from the same point.

    The general usage of most `debug` subtools is:

        polygraphy debug <subtool> <model> [--artifacts files_to_sort_each_iteration...] \
            [--check <checker_command>]
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("debug")

    def add_parser_args(self, parser):
        subparsers = parser.add_subparsers(title="Debug Subtools", dest="subtool")
        subparsers.required = True

        SUBTOOLS = [
            Build(),
            Precision(),
            DiffTactics(),
            Reduce(),
            Repeat(),
        ]

        for subtool in SUBTOOLS:
            subtool.setup_parser(subparsers)
